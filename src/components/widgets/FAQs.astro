			question: 'What are your hours of operation?',
			answer: `BLT is currently open 6:00 am-5:30 pm Monday-Friday.
			We provide our holiday closure schedule one year in advance.
			In case of inclement weather, BLT follows the local <a href="https://www.sblschools.com/district/" target="_blank" class="text-[#087BB8] text-extrabold">Sergeant Bluff-Luton School District</a> for closures and delays.`,
		},
		{
			question: 'How is daily communication handled?',
			answer: `BLT utilizes a childcare management software system called <a href="https://help.tryplayground.com/en/articles/5356813-parent-app-overview" target="_blank" class="text-[#087BB8] text-extrabold">Playground</a>. Families have access to an app containing a daily news feed that keeps them up to date on all classroom happenings. Playground also allows families the ability to private chat with administrators. Playground utilizes a calendar feature where you can find all holiday closures, notifications of special events, and other important dates that families need to be aware of. We also utilize this system for invoice payments. Families can view all invoices (current and past) and access any recorded payments at the click of a button on their smartphones. Families also clock their children in and out daily in the lobby via a personal pin code. We prioritize our families being up to date on all happenings within our center and feeling included in all classroom events.

			question: 'How do your meals work?',
			answer: `Here at BLT, your meals are included in your weekly tuition cost. We serve breakfast, A.M. snack, lunch, and P.M. snack. We participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program, ensuring that your child receives well-balanced, nutritious meals. Lunches are catered daily by <a href="https://aggiesbbq.com/" target="_blank" class="text-[#087BB8] text-extrabold">Aggies</a>, our local catering company, while all other meals are handled by our staff. During the summer months, we take full advantage of our local farmers' market by purchasing produce and meat from local vendors. Doing this allows us to support them and give our children access to locally-grown foods that are as healthy as they are delicious.`,

		{
			question: 'How does preschool work?',
			answer: `Here at BLT, we provide access to a Statewide Voluntary Preschool Program classroom. We partner with the <a href="https://www.sblschools.com/district/" target="_blank" class="text-[#087BB8] text-extrabold">Sergeant Bluff-Luton School District</a> to provide this service to our families. Our partnership allows our families to have access to a certified school district teacher during preschool hours while also allowing them to have surround care outside of those hours. Preschool hours are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 8:15 A.M. -11:00 A.M. Children must turn 4 years of age on or before September 15th of the enrolling school year.`,
