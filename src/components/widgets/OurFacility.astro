		Located conveniently on 1st street directly across from the local Primary School building in Sgt Bluff, Iowa, you
		can find BLT! Our facility was extensively renovated in 2021 into 2022. The goal of these renovations was to create
		a child focused facility that lets our children grow, develop and be their best. Our facility includes 5 beautiful
		classrooms, over 6,000 square feet of playground for children as little as 6 months and a sensory room for children
		with special and unique needs.

						receive physical exercise but also unstructured playtime that is essential for the development of
						self-regulation skills.

						projectors, bubble tubes, a marble wall and much more provide a visual and hands on soothing experience, a
						vibrating platform that provides a relaxing and calming vibration to soothe the body during sensory overload
						and an overall space to calm and desensitize. Students with autism, sensory processing disorder, ADHD, and
